Data Cleaning and Exploration:

Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Explore basic statistics for each column (mean, median, min, max, etc.) to understand the distribution of data.
Check for any outliers in numerical columns.
Monthly Analysis:

Explore the overall trend of flight delays over the months. You can create a line chart or bar chart to visualize how delays vary from January to August.
Airport Analysis:

Identify airports with the highest number of delays. You can group by both origin and destination airports to see patterns.
State-wise Analysis:

Analyze delays based on the origin and destination states. This can give insights into whether delays are more common in certain regions.
Time of Day Analysis:

Explore if there are specific times of the day when delays are more common. You can categorize departure and arrival times into bins and analyze delays in each time bin.
Flight Distance vs. Delay:

Investigate if there's a correlation between the distance of the flight and the delay. You can create a scatter plot to visualize this relationship.
Cancellation and Diversion Analysis:

Explore the reasons for cancellations and diversions. Analyze the frequency and reasons for these events.
Delay Causes:

Explore the different causes of delays, such as carrier delay, weather delay, NAS delay, security delay, and late aircraft delay. Identify which factors contribute most to delays.
Correlation Analysis:

Investigate if there are correlations between different delay types. For example, does weather delay often coincide with late aircraft delay?
Flight Carrier Analysis:

Analyze delays by different carriers. Identify if certain airlines are more prone to delays than others.
Flight Duration Analysis:

Explore if there's a relationship between the duration of the flight (air time) and the likelihood of delays.
Delay Impact on Arrival Times:

Investigate how departure delays impact arrival delays. Is there a linear relationship between the two?
Machine Learning Predictions:

If you're interested in prediction, consider building a machine learning model to predict delays based on various features in the dataset.
Geospatial Analysis:

If you have latitude and longitude information for airports, you can perform geospatial analysis to visualize where delays are more common on a map.
Time Series Analysis:

If your dataset includes a timestamp, consider time series analysis to identify patterns and trends in delays over time.
